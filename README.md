### To Preface, a Note About Data Collection

In the data api notebook you will notice that our team wrote a program that takes data directly from 'The Movie Database' API. While you are more than welcome to run that query and get the most up-to-date data, be wary that the query will take between two and three hours to run.

## Abstract

When you are looking to start a succcesful movie studio, you need a few different things. The first is lots of money. In general, movies make more the more you put into them as a resource. This can also be applied to the talent attached to the projet. Better writers, directors, actors, etc. will increase the potential earnings. Furthermore, both Action and Animated are two (relatively) sure bets to get butts in theater seats. If you are unable to cough up the bedgetary requirements for a blockbuster, both the Music and Horror genres offer high rates of return, even on small investments.

## Data Description

Copies of the data we used and how we prepared it for analysis are included in this repository. We have sourced our data primarily from 'Rotten Tomatoes,' 'IMDB,' and 'The Movie Database.'

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for a succesful foray into the realm of movie magic:

- **Spend money to make money.** It's a saying for a reason, the more resources that a project is allocated, the better it will perform.
- **Your people are your greatest asset.** The moviemaking business is the same as all others in this regard.
- **Know your audience.** The jury has spoken, Animation and Adventure movies are the ones that draw the biggest crowds.

### Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights:

- Potential release dates for increased revenue
- Advertising/Marketing ROI effets
- Editing/Special Effects impacts
